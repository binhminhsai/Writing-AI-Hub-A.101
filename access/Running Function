
Based on the source code and the output you've shared, the project is a FastAPI application that already includes both the backend and frontend in a single codebase. There's no separate frontend build step required.

To run the entire project with all features:

```bash
python run_dev.py
```

This command starts both the backend API and serves the frontend static files from the public directory. As shown in your output, the server runs at http://0.0.0.0:8000.

For production with real OpenAI API calls (instead of mock responses):

```bash
python -m uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Your current setup is already running properly with:
- OpenAI API key detected and loaded
- Server running at http://0.0.0.0:8000
- Frontend access available at the same URL

You should be able to access the two main features at:
- http://localhost:8000/workflow_1_question (Question Generator)
- http://localhost:8000/workflow_2_grading (Essay Grading)

Or view the main menu at:
- http://localhost:8000/
