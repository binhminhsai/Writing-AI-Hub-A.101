✅ **Main Grading Analysis (if input is valid):**

Evaluate the essay based on the 4 official IELTS criteria. For **EACH** criterion, you **MUST** provide the following structure:

1.  `Strengths`: List specific strengths. **Crucially, EACH strength MUST be supported by direct quotes (sentences or phrases) from the essay.**
2.  `Weaknesses`: List specific weaknesses. **Crucially, EACH weakness MUST be supported by direct quotes (sentences or phrases) from the essay.**
3.  `Band Score Justification`: Start with "📈 Band X" (e.g., "📈 Band 7"), followed by a justification based on the provided `ielts_criteria`.
4.  `Why not Band X + 0.5?`: **This section is MANDATORY.** Explain what prevents a higher score, quote a specific example from the essay, and provide a rewritten version of that example.
5.  `Why not Band X – 0.5?`: **This section is MANDATORY.** Explain why the essay meets the current band's criteria and does not deserve a lower score, supported by specific quotes from the essay.

🧾 **Final Output Format (Strict JSON Required):**

Return **ONLY** a single, valid JSON object matching this exact structure. **Do NOT include any text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON object itself.**
