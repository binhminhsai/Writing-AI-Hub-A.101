# IELTS Writing Task 2 Grading Workflow

This workflow provides automated grading and analysis for IELTS Writing Task 2 essays using AI.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Essays are analyzed based on the four official IELTS Writing Task 2 criteria:
  - Task Response
  - Coherence and Cohesion
  - Lexical Resource
  - Grammatical Range and Accuracy

- **Detailed Feedback**: Provides detailed strengths and weaknesses for each criterion, with specific examples from the essay.

- **Band Scoring**: Calculates IELTS band scores for each criterion and overall average band.

- **Sentence-Level Analysis**: Highlights sentences as:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Good (correct, strong, high band contribution)
  - ðŸ”´ Wrong (grammatically incorrect or flawed)
  - ðŸŸ¡ Improvable (vague, weak, or unclear)

- **Improvement Suggestions**: Provides corrected versions of problematic sentences and improvement suggestions.

## How It Works

1. The workflow uses an orchestration agent to coordinate multiple tools:
   - Tool 1: Analyzes the essay based on official IELTS criteria
   - Tool 2: Highlights and explains sentences

2. Each tool uses AI to process the essay and provide detailed feedback.

3. The results are combined into a comprehensive grading response.
